# Knowledge Graph Embedding Project

This project is dedicated to building a knowledge graph embedding model aimed at integrating cellular data to elucidate the complexities of cellular pathways, cell signaling, genetic interactions, and more. 

## Current Status

Currently, the project leverages the Hetionet dataset, which is commonly used for drug repurposing studies. Hetionet is a rich resource that integrates multiple types of biological data and has been widely utilized in biomedical research.

## Goals

- **Short-term:** Develop and validate a knowledge graph embedding model using Hetionet data to demonstrate its potential in understanding complex biological interactions.
- **Long-term:** Integrate comprehensive cellular data to enhance the model's capability in supporting intricate cellular processes, pathway interactions, and genetic relationships.

## Future Work

The ultimate aim of this project is to extend beyond Hetionet to include more detailed cellular data. This will help in providing deeper insights into cellular complexities and facilitate advanced research in areas such as drug discovery, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.

## Usage

For now, the project focuses on data analysis, model training, and validation using Hetionet data. Instructions and documentation for using the current model will be provided as the project progresses.

## Disclaimer

This project is still under construction. Contributions and feedback are welcome, but please note that the current implementation is preliminary and subject to significant changes.
